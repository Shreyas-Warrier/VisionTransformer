Overcoming Limitations of CNNs
</font></h2></div>

### Limited Global Context:
- **CNNs**: Traditional CNNs often struggle to capture extensive long-range dependencies within images due to their localized receptive fields and hierarchical feature extraction.
- **ViTs**: Vision Transformers excel in capturing long-range dependencies within images by employing self-attention mechanisms. This allows ViTs to analyze global context and relationships between distant image regions more effectively compared to CNNs.

### Increased Parameter Dependency:
- **CNNs**: As CNNs grow in depth and complexity, they tend to become increasingly dependent on a larger number of parameters, potentially hindering efficiency and scalability.
- **ViTs**: Vision Transformers often demonstrate improved parameter efficiency compared to CNNs. By leveraging self-attention mechanisms and token-based processing, ViTs can achieve enhanced performance with fewer parameters, leading to more efficient model architectures.

### Versatility Across Tasks:
- **CNNs**: While CNNs are primarily used for tasks such as image classification, they may struggle to generalize across different computer vision tasks or adapt to diverse datasets.
- **ViTs**: Vision Transformers showcase versatility, proving effective across various computer vision tasks beyond image classification. They can be easily adapted to tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and image generation, making them suitable for a wide range of applications.

### Adaptability to Diverse Datasets:
- **CNNs**: CNNs may face challenges when applied to datasets with varying complexities or characteristics, requiring extensive architectural modifications or hyperparameter tuning.
- **ViTs**: Vision Transformers exhibit adaptability to diverse datasets, making them promising contenders for real-world applications with varying data complexities. Their token-based processing approach allows them to process input data of varying resolutions and formats without significant modifications to the model architecture.
